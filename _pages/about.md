I'm a PhD student in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon, working with [Andrew Kern](http://kernlab.org) and [Peter Ralph](https://pages.uoregon.edu/plr/). I'm broadly interested in population genetics and computational biology. For my PhD, I have been working on how different evolutionary processes shape the landscapes of genetic diversity.

I received my M.Sc. in Genetics and Evolutionary Biology in 2018 and B.Sc. in Biology in 2016, both from the University of Sao Paulo. I worked on genome-wide clinal and seasonal variation in *D. melanogaster* under [Rodrigo Cogni](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/ecoevo)'s supervision. I also studied geographic variation in *D. melanogaster* immunity genes and phenotypes in collaboration with [John Pool](http://johnpool.net).
